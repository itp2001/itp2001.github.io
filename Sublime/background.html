    	<p>I was born in York, Maine on February 28th, 2001. I lived in a green house on top of a hill. I grew up with both of my parents and two younger brothers, Hunter and Colby. My favorite thing to do growing up was surfing the three beaches my hometown had. I began snowboarding at the age of 12 and spent most of my winters since than at Gunstock Ski resort in Gilford, NH. I have attended York schools my entire life. I am currently employed under my fathers land surveying business, Kimball Survey and Design. </p>
