    	<p>I have been snowboarding for 7 years now, it has become part of my life. I taught myself how ride at Shawnee Peak in Bridgton Maine.</p>

    	<p> After three years of school sanctioned ski trips to Shawnee, I began to branch out. I began to take weekend trips to Gunstock Mtn in Gilford, NH with my friends every weekend. I bought my first season pass my Sophomore year of highschool and my love for snowboarding truly took off. Since than I have taken many week long trips to Vermont just to ski. I have spent countless hours in my backyard working on tricks and in the backountry perfecting my riding. <p>

    	<p>This winter break I have a trip planned with my best friend to fly out to Big Sky, Montana. Snowboarding has and will remain a huge part of my life<p>
